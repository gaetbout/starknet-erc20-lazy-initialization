# starknet-erc20-lazy-initialization
## ü™Ç Description
Open now your wallet on ~~Goerli~~ Mainnet and add this token:  
**0x06321571ce6f884a184e6c5872dfb2b833201c5a4707c1bce0bfb62f252192ee**.  
You should see a balance of 1.000 GAET s.  
Deploy a new wallet and add the token again... It also has 1.000 GAETs.  
Every existing wallet or wallet that will ever exist will have 1.000 GAETs. Wait whaaaaaat?  
But how, why, again what?  
  
This is the biggest airdrop ever. Every address existing or that will exist will have 1.000 tokens of this token.  
I didn't run a computer to send this token to every possible address I just modifid the default implementation of an ERC20 contract to make it lazy initialized.  
Note that it could also be used as a testnet (or even mainnet) token to avoid user to have to mint the tokens.  
[Link to the deployed contract](https://starkscan.co/contract/0x06321571ce6f884a184e6c5872dfb2b833201c5a4707c1bce0bfb62f252192ee)  

## ü§î But how?
First I started by copying [the default ERC20 of OpenZeppelin (at this date)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/cairo-1/src/openzeppelin/token/erc20.cairo). Then I just had to adapt two methods.  
In this case, we want to give each user 1.000 tokens, and there are 18 decimals to our token.  
When I speak about a unit of token refer to 10<sup>-18</sup> (for Ethereum is is Wei)

### ‚öñÔ∏è balanceOf
Because this is the entry point of an ERC20 to read the balance of a user (how unexpected, right?), this is where we have to make our first little modification.  
It is as simple as reading the actual balance of the user and: 
 - if it is 0 we return a "fake" value with the initial tokens we want to grant each user (1.000 tokens in this case).
 - if it is not zero, we just return the balance minus 1 (this will be explained in the next section (hint: 1 is the new zero)).  

### üì§ _transfer
This is were the magic happens (understand: lazy initialization).  
This is the same as written by OpenZeppelin with some adjustemnts:  
 1. Checking that the UINT256 is valid (no modification)
 2. Checking that the sender is valid (no modification)
 3. Checking that the receiver is valid (no modification)
 4. Checking that the sender and the receiver have funds, if not we mint 1.000 tokens + 1 unit of token them for each addresses of the transfer.  
 Why initialize both addresses?  
 This is to avoid people sending 1 unit of the token to someone and make their initial balance to zero.  
 Why adding 1 unit of token to the balance?
 This acts as the new zero, since balanceOf is going the return either 1.000 (when not initialized) or the actual balance value minus 1.
 So if the user has 1 unit of token the balance won't go in the zero condition and return balance minus one ( 1 - 1 = 0 ) therefore zero. 
 5. Checking that there is enough funds to make the transfer.  
 This part had to be updated to make use of balanceOf instead of reading directly from the storage var.
 6. Updating the sender's balance.  
 This also has to be modified because we have to take care to add back 1 unit of token to make the balanceOf function working correctly.
 7. The rest is unchanged
